//CODE STATEMENT:
    //alice introduced new online game with n levels
    //each day she introduces a level on random but not necessarily increasing
    //a level cannot be launched twice
    //player can play higher level than the one they have completed
    //player gets one reward for each level completed
    //you need to maximize the number of rewards you can get by playing as many levels as possible
    //goal is to find the maximum rewards you can earn based on launch order
    //input should be the number of levels and the launch order of levels
